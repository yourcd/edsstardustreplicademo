# skills/replica/scripts/gate.sh — one pixel-gate round in one command
#
# Stitches both sides (live capture CACHED across iterations — hit
# minimization, source-fidelity-gate.md § Iteration discipline), runs
# pixel-compare, and prints the verdict lines that drive the loop (size /
# height delta / differing % / hot bands). The prototype/build side is
# re-captured every round; the live side only when live.png is absent —
# delete it explicitly to re-take (site changed, capture hardening changed).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/replica/gate.sh <slug> <live-url> <build-url> <width> [iter-label] [--marker <string>]
#
# Example (iteration 2 of the home archetype at 1440):
#   scripts/replica/gate.sh home "https://<site>/" \
#     "http://localhost:8791/home-proposed.html" 1440 iter2
#
# Evidence lands in stardust/replica/gates/<slug>-<width>/
# (live.png, build.png, diff-<label>.png).
#
# Fail-loud contract: a stitch-shot bot challenge (exit 3) or capture error
# aborts the round — a missing/blocked side must never be compared. Exit
# codes: 0 gate PASS, 2 gate FAIL (over threshold), 3 bot challenge,
# 1 capture/compare error, 4 build-side identity assertion failed (the URL
# serves something that isn't this project's page — wrong/stale server).

# Identity assertion — NEVER diff an unverified build URL (two field
# harvests, 2026-08: the same incident in both sessions, opposite directions —
# a stale localhost:8791 server from ANOTHER stardust project served a foreign
# site into a gate round; 73% diff misread as "prototype broke" on one, the
# foreign prototype measured as "the build" on the other. Every skill doc
# suggests the same port, so cross-project collision is guaranteed on a shared
# machine). Fetch the build side and require a page-specific marker: default
# is the <slug> (already in the served filename/URL path, so it normally
# appears in the HTML); pass --marker when the slug string genuinely doesn't
# occur in the page. KNOWN LIMIT of the slug default: when the stale server
# is ANOTHER stardust project sharing the slug (two projects both serving
# home-proposed.html), its page likely contains the slug too and false-
# passes — on shared machines pass --marker with a site-specific string
# (brand name, domain). Runs BEFORE any capture so a collision costs one
# curl, not a gate round. -L: published/preview origins redirect (https,
# trailing slash) — an unfollowed redirect must not read as a mismatch.
